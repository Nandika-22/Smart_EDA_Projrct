# Smart Exploratory Data Analysis on Shopping Trends

Smart EDA project performs a smart and structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a shopping trends dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior and spending patterns using Python-based analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on exploring numerical and categorical features, identifying relationships with purchase amount, detecting outliers, and extracting meaningful insights relevant to retail and e-commerce decision-making.

## Steps Involved
- Data loading and inspection  
- Data type and missing value validation  
- Numerical feature analysis and visualization  
- Categorical feature comparison with purchase amount  
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps  
- Outlier detection using the IQR method  

## Tech Stack Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Scikit-learn  

## Results
- Purchase amount shows stable behavior across customer age groups  
- Discounts and promo codes influence spending patterns  
- Subscription users demonstrate consistent purchasing behavior  
- No significant outliers detected, indicating clean and reliable data
